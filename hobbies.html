      Outside of academics, I’m passionate about baseball analytics and game strategy. I love collecting data about
      player stats, visualizing patterns in batting averages, and comparing modern players to historical legends.
      I also enjoy writing, and watching but also playing sports. These activities help me stay creative and energetic,
      giving me balance between analytical thinking and fun. Whether it’s coding, writing, or running on a field, I find
      that every experience helps me look at data from a new perspective.
