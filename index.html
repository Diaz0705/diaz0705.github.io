        Hi! My name is Brandon Diaz, and this website is all about my passion for data science and baseball analytics.
  I’m currently studying data science at Northeastern University, where I explore how data can be used to tell
  meaningful stories about performance, teamwork, and changes. I love visualizing data through Python and learning
  how machine learning can help us make better predictions. Baseball has always been one of my favorite sports, and
  combining it with data makes it even more fascinating to me. I enjoy analyzing player statistics, comparing
  historical data to modern trends, and discovering how small details can impact overall team success.  
  When I’m not working with data, I like spending time watching games, reading about technology, and learning new
  coding techniques to improve my projects. I believe that data science isn’t just about numbers — it’s about finding
  patterns that help us understand the world a little better. Through this website, I hope to share some of my insights about the connection between data and sports. Thanks for visiting, and I hope
  you enjoy exploring what I’ve built here!
